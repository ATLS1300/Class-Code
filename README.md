# Class-Code
<i>Example scripts of code that we build in class!</i>
<br>
<br>
The code in this repository serves as a way to check your code that you build in class against tested and finalized code! <b>
  
<br>
Good practices with this code:
<br>1. <b>TRY FIRST</b> - Sure, you can come here and look at and copy the code and produce the goals that you want, but you're taking this class to UNDERSTAND how to code. So try to meet the pseudocode goals, THEN look at/copy the parts needed to fix any errors.
<br>2. <b>ASK QUESTIONS</b> - If there's part of the code you don't understand, or if we implemented a solution differently than you, ask about it! Bad programmers use code they don't understand! Don't be a bad programmer.
<br>3. <b>AUGMENT</b> - Demonstrate your understanding by <i>changing</i> the code. Change colors, size, and/or the position of the pattern. Change the organization of the code to suit your goals. You will get higher points for changing ANY code that you borrow!
<br>4. <b>CITE THE CODE</b> - While using this code in your programs without citation will not mean plagiarism (because we work on it together in class), you should still practice citing code. You would add something like: <br>
# Modified code from class code
